                        <p>Making it Clickable</p>
                        <p>I'm a front-end web developer and this site is a showcase of some of my work and abilities.</p>
                        <p>I have been working in the field of web development since 2003 and doing it professionally since 2006. After I graduated from the Art Institute of Portland with a <acronym title="Bachelors of Science">BS</acronym> in Multimedia &amp; Web Design, I was hired by an interactive agency specializing in rich internet Flash applications.</p>
                        <p>I like the challenge of taking a complex design comp and transforming it into a usable and engaging website or application. I have learned that there are many ways to design, and that you are only limited by your imagination. When I'm not on the web I like to read books and watch movies.</p>
                        <p>My skills include: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, ActionScript 2 &amp; 3.</p>
						<p>I'm currently looking for any full-time or freelance opportunities. Please <a href="contact">contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
